 * ODBC/CLI uses SQLLEN* as the indicator pointer for SQLBindCol.
 *
 * This header is also included by PostgreSQL-facing translation units where
 * the DB2 CLI headers cannot be included.  In addition, SQLLEN is 32 bit for
 * the native Db2 CLI build and 64 bit for some ODBC builds.  Binding the
 * driver directly to an intptr_t therefore gives it an object of the wrong
 * effective type on at least one of these builds.
 *
 * Keep an aligned, opaque eight-byte area for the driver-owned SQLLEN value.
 * DB2 CLI translation units copy the value to val_null after each fetch.  That
 * keeps the SQLBindCol ABI separate from the portable result metadata.

 * on the other hand, use the physical relation attribute order.  The two
 * layouts cannot be inferred from the number of slot attributes: a reordered
